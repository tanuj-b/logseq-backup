		- Hi I'm Lalitesh
			- Im an engineer by taining and by heart.I did an undergraduate in Aerospace and a Ph.D in robotics
			- I sold my company to Google in 2002, the first company Google ever bought.
			- I moved back to India built the technology behind the technology you know as Google Maps
			- I started Indihood in 2014, where we started building the LKP Loom
			- Along the way, I got lucky and was involved in some software projects & govt committees such as .. ,Aarogya Setu,

	  heading:: 2
		- all of these journeys have happened because I would come up with some ideaas, and often people would say it can't be done. And the key question to ask is Why? Why do you say we can't? Is it impossible or just really, really hard.
		- why can't? Why can't we? And by asking that question, we learnt of things, problems, ideas that I have worked on. And I think all of those led me right here to HDFC store. And I believe that hopefully I can convince you why I am extremely excited about this particular conversation.

	- ## Narrative
	  heading:: 2
		- I sold my company to Google.
			- I started working on the, when I came in, I realized the company itself, when the technology is doing good, the company itself was a mess.
			- The wisdom on how to do that was to hire accountats and non-engineers, which the company didn't want to do.
			- So I asked, why can't we do this with software?
			- And all these software engineers, who wanted to work on interesting problems like search and scaling, refused to work though on much more mundane, unsexy things like performance management and payroll.
		- So I helped Google build everything. In two years, we went from X to Y.

	- ## Narrative
	  heading:: 2
		- After that stint I got to pick any problem I wanted.
			- I spoke to Larry and I got my pick of projects
			- They were discussing this idea of Google Maps.
			- So we asked the question. Somebody said, OK, there are only so many maps available, you know, but it can't be done.
		- And I asked the question, why can't we?
			- It turns out that even if you can see the images in a satellite, you still need the computer to know, this is a road, this is a building, etc.
			- It's hard to just look at a street and know. The knoweldge was out there, but with the people of the world.
			- Every street, every building, every whatever needs to be mapped. The wisdom was that only experts can do it. And each expert costed $000s
		- How do you bring the expertise of thousands(stay on the lit up map), these thousands are global remote distributed.
			- And the answer was MapMaker.
				- And MapMaker really was a set of tools given to the world to go out and look at photos of their own area and map the world.
				- Knowledge and the expertise is distributed, how do you centralise it?
					- Software, how do we make software that works around the world
				- But we needed their inputs, right? Even if you had satellite data, roads, etc., you need curators. We came up with a system of how we got this. MapMaker was probably one of the most widely, right, everybody assumes Google, they must do some fancy computer algorithm to get the maps. This is what they did. I built this over eight years with that team. Once we had that team and we went, a lot of that team joined me. And together we started the mission IndyHood. Because we realized that if what we could do with MapMaker, the fact that we could literally map the world.
			-
		- Summarise MapMaker again
			- Sparse learning engine to figure out mapmaker user trust to 98% accuracy (measured) : AI
			- A distributed geo-spatial data toolkit that allows hundreds & thousands of experts to help us map the world.
			- Technology to help the hard, labor intensive work that makes the magic of a map-assisted journey possible.

		- I had the chance to once again ask Google for any project I wanted
			- But instead, the team and I were already clear we were on to something
			- We had seen the power of technology when put into the hands of the people
			- So we wanted to do more of that
		- That's when Avanti came alive. We didn't know what it would mean, but we knew that was our ambition
		- We realised that if you want to take the power of software to every problem and all the people's of the world, then you have to do something meta. We started building something ambitious that we thought could make making software itself easier.

  heading:: 1
	- ## Content
	  heading:: 2
		- AP Fibre content
	- ## Narrative
	  heading:: 2
		- AP Fiber wanted to correct everybody. (Connect the World)
			- Connect X million people to the global information superhighway.
			- Can't be done. We could only lay so many kms of cable everyday, would've taken ZZ years.
			- So I asked why not?
		- Because expertise was the bottleneck.
			- Too expensive to dig and then redig, so need to make everything done correctly and it works. There were only a handful of experts.
			- Training exprts don't scale. What do all these fibre laying experts do after?
			- So we found ourselves with the opposite problem of mapmaker. Expertise of a few central experts needed to be scaled all the way to the eyes and hands who were laying fibre. We did it digitally
			- Please remember this was not an application to fill a form and do compliance of whether a pole was erected. This was a tool for every technician to solve problems on their job by getting live, correct feedback. They were rewarded not punished for asking questions.
			- The fact that you got data was nice side effect, the point of it was helping the technicians move fast!

		- I was asked to hellp build this, we dropped everything else and focussed.
		- The key idea was how do we know what the hell was going on with this invisble virus, that only showed delayed symptoms. By the time you definitely know, you already have a problem.
			- (Like an NPA.. remember this for later)
		- Also people aren't employed by the government. You can't mandateusing the app, even though they tried. We had to figure out a reason for people to come, to share things with us.
		- So first we looked for data elsewhere:
			- Cell phone towers AI
				- Predict hot spots from crowdsourced symptoms and cell tower tracesÂ (fusion) to 99% prediction of hotspots i.e. when infections are going to arise 7 to 21 days before they did.
			- And we built a health tool for customers, that got them to install it.
				- We built advanced bluetooth tracing to figure out potential contacts. And then we scaled it to tracking symptoms and advanced hotspot prediciton based on the data we were getting

			- So this was Nandan and Tata. They wanted to give credit at scale, and people said it can't be done. So they called and asked me - can it actually not be done?
			- How can we give everybody in India a loan on our terms? People said it can't be done. And I say it can be done. And here's the story of how we did it.

	  heading:: 2
		- ### Content
		  heading:: 3
			- Picture of the punch cards
		- ### Narrative
		  heading:: 3
			- Punch car
			- And the technology behind the technology is the LKP Loom.
				- The LKP Loom is what we call our platform generator. It's not something that is a platform. It is what creates the platform. It allows us to express. LKP Loom. Because like punch cards, first named after the Jacquard Loom. The Jacquard Loom gave us punch cards, the Jacquard gave us all of computing. Because it was the first time that people realized, sure, mechanically, but so far, it's the first instance that we know of, where the machine had some, at least some ability to make decisions. It was programmed.
				- Which will we should forward here, is add the example that, you know, we you know, crunched what would be 1,500,000 lines of code into 25,000. Yeah.
				  That that that is the loom metaphor. Yeah. It's the loom effect. To life.
				  What would have been 1,500,000 individual leads is now just a very compact 5,000 holes. Right? Like Punch cuts. Yeah.
				- The first machine that was programmed.was programmed. In some sense it was the first machine that was programmed. It ran a program. Right? In the most, in a reasonably capable sense, it was the first machine to ever be programmed. The loom was the first machine to ever be programmed. To the point where programmers, when they realized what computers could do, when they needed a way to tell the computer, hey look, do this or do that, they took inspiration from the loom. And the punch cards continued for a long while after, because it was a reasonable format, till we realized we could actually have keyboards and type it in. Mainframes ran on punch cards for a while. That's the idea, that if you just had the punch cards. Those punch cards were very very useful. Eventually those punch cards themselves would be abstracted by computers etc., but the idea of the punch card programming was powerful.

			- Software is and always should be means to an end
			- It is hard to get everything right on the first try. Businesses think, do, act and learn to do it all over again.
			- Your software needs to change with every iteration.
			- When software ossifies, you have to grow awkwardly around it.
			- Whereas the LKP Loom promises that the fabric will grow around your problem / be custom to you
			- Because of the design of how we've abstracted the platform, we've reduced the complexity of your operations down to understandable configurations.

- # Graduation Ladder
  heading:: 1
	- Content
		- The graduation ladder
	- Narrative
		- The reason Avanti was so successful was because the technology behind Avanti is powerful. It is the LKP loom
		- Not an LMS built around loans, but a platform built around the people - the borrowers, the field staff, the auditors - how do we help them work together?
	- Notes
		- Emphasis on the shift - not LMS for loans. How do we build a business around these people that not too many people build for?
		- Repeat technology behind the technology
		- But a platform built because people have diverse financial lives, and they need credit sometimes. We want to have an easy way to give it to them, and a robust way to collect it back.

		- Can bankers focus on banking not process?
	- ### Narrative
	  heading:: 3
		- It means that we are here not to digitize your firms, but to understand, but to actually transform your office. It's not to digitize, it's to paperless. But essentially, it can be designed software for the people of your branches. That software that amplifies the people of your branches, that changes transaction from 90 to 90-10, from 90-10 which is process banking to 90-banking-10 process.
			- How do we make that shift? How do we get it to happen? How do we do it such that your operations can be sliced and diced and you can try various ways in which you can do things. Today, the form, the process dictates what the employees can and cannot do. The process dictates the experiences that they have. The process is ultimately bottlenecked by your software.
			- Compliant records should be the output of banking, not complaince being the core job of banking.
		- Who is paying the cost of bad software?
			- It's your users, it's your staff, it's your attrition. It's probably going to be cheaper or the same in cost in rupee terms. But we are going to be incredibly lighter, more freeing in overheads. The overhead of a slow application, the overhead of customers needing exceptions for a large set of your customers being exceptions.
			- You want software that works for everyone in your organization. Not one software that works for one scenario and then n softwares for n scenarios.
			- You want one loom that generates any varieties or versions of fabrics that you may need. Everyone weards the same drab grey, but you have the chance to bring in color and expression, without losing the advantages of having a single backbone.
			- You can let branches in assam have exceptions and still get coherent data and real time updates. This is not some fancy technology, this is good design. We have good expertise and design on how to build this.

	- [This we can insert in those stories]
	- And in the AI slide, note that the best state of the art AI will get us to 80-90%;
	- we will use context, RL and reduced problem space to up that to 95-98% in simpler cases,
	- to 80+% in complex cases; e.g. extracting precise instructions from Board resolutions; ensure we generate a confidence interval thats accurate, and use that to trigger maker checker.
	- The above can be a simple funnel diagram with one-two word annotations;
	- The point is to convey we are AI first natively from way back; and understand,
	- (most AI usage rarelyÂ gets to 3 sigma as u know)
